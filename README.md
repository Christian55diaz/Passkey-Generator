# Passkey-Generator
Welcome to my first ever Javascript challenge/repo. If I am being honest javascript is more challenging than html and css. 
I want to learn and improve my skills on js over the next weeks. My improve skills will allow me to make websites and generators at a faster rate while mantaining a clean coding spcae. 
This being my first javascript challenge it took me longer that I wouldve imagined. I am sumbiting this days later but I rather submit my work in as good as I can, even if I loose points on the lateness of my submission. 

I have learned 2 major things from js:
  1. You can combined alot of your code in one or two lines that does the same work as 4-5 lines of code. 
  2. one variable change, one if statment, one constant statment can bug your js script in the matter of seconds.

Things I need to improve on javascript are: 
  1. making my codes neater for the next developer reviewing it.
  2. allowing my self to make mistakes and catch upon them later on instead of getting stuck and heldup on the one bug.

I had alot of fun completeing this challenge, I cant wait to start the web api's challenge and crush it.
